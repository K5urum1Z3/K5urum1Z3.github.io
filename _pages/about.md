<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student at the School of Mathematics, Hefei University of Technology (HFUT), majoring in Information and Computational Science. I am set to begin my doctoral studies at the School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).

My research interests lie in 3D Vision Encoding and Compression, AIGC, and related fields. I am passionate about developing new techniques for efficient 3D data representation and processing, as well as exploring the potentials of artificial intelligence in content generation.

In my spare time, I enjoy sports, listening to music (especially G.E.M.), and watching anime.
